## Student Alcohol Consumption


# **Exploring the Impact of Alcohol Consumption on High School Students’ Academic Performance and Well-Being**


## **Project Description**

This project examines how alcohol consumption affects high school students, particularly in relation to their **academic performance** and **overall well-being**. I will be using real-world student data from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository* to analyze the relationship between alcohol consumption—both on weekdays and weekends—and key factors such as **grades, study habits, health, and social behaviors**.

I would also apply fundamental **statistical methods**, including *correlation analysis, t-tests, and regression modeling*, to uncover patterns in student behavior and highlight the potential academic and personal consequences of alcohol use.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is from a survey of secondary school students and includes detailed information on **academic performance, alcohol consumption, social behaviors, and family background**. It is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
