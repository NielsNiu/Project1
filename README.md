# **Project Description**

This project examines how alcohol consumption affects high school students, particularly in relation to their **academic performance** and **overall well-being**. Using real-world student data from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, I analyze the relationship between alcohol consumption—both on weekdays and weekends—and key factors such as **grades, study habits, health, and social behaviors**.

By applying fundamental **statistical methods**, including *correlation analysis, t-tests, and regression modeling*, this study aims to uncover patterns in student behavior and highlight the potential academic and personal consequences of alcohol use.

# **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project comes from a survey of secondary school students and includes detailed information on **academic performance, alcohol consumption, social behaviors, and family background**. It is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
