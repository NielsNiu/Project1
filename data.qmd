# **Data**

## **Dataset Overview**  

The dataset for this project comes from a survey conducted among secondary school students taking **Math** and **Portuguese** courses. It contains a variety of demographic, academic, and social factors that provide insights into students' lifestyles, family backgrounds, study habits, and alcohol consumption patterns. The dataset is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and is widely used for educational and research purposes.

## **Dataset Structure**  

The dataset consists of two files:  
- **`student-mat.csv`** – Data from students taking the Math course.  
- **`student-por.csv`** – Data from students taking the Portuguese course.  

A total of **33 attributes** are included, covering:  
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, school, home address type.  
- **Family Background:** Parents' education and jobs, family size, parental cohabitation status, and family relationship quality.  
- **Academic Performance:** Grades for three periods (**G1, G2, G3**) and study-related factors like study time, failures, and support programs.  
- **Social Behavior:** Extra-curricular activities, free time, going out with friends, romantic relationships.  
- **Health and Attendance:** Self-reported health status and number of absences.  
- **Alcohol Consumption:** Workday alcohol consumption (**Dalc**) and weekend alcohol consumption (**Walc**).  

## **Key Variables of Interest**  

- **Academic Performance**: `G1`, `G2`, `G3` (final grade as the target variable).  
- **Alcohol Consumption**: `Dalc` (weekday alcohol use) and `Walc` (weekend alcohol use).  
- **Social & Family Factors**: `goout` (frequency of going out with friends), `famrel` (family relationship quality), `romantic` (romantic relationship status).  
- **Health & Well-being**: `health` (self-reported health), `absences` (number of absences), `studytime` (weekly study hours).  

## **Data Considerations**  

- **Duplicate Students**: Some students (382) appear in both datasets and can be identified through identical demographic characteristics.  
- **Categorical vs. Numeric Data**: Some variables are categorical (e.g., `sex`, `address`), while others are numeric (e.g., `age`, `grades`).  
- **Potential Biases**: The dataset reflects students from a specific region and may not generalize to broader populations.
