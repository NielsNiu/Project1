# Conclusion

This study looks at how drinking alcohol, having a social life, and getting support from family impact students' grades. Many think that drinking affects grades, but the evidence shows that alcohol use doesnâ€™t significantly impact school performance. The best way to guess a student's final grade is by checking their past grades. Doing well at the start of the school year is important for success, and working hard regularly is more important than any one habit or action.  

There is a correlation between student achievement and family support. Encouragement from parents and guardians can have a significant impact, as having a strong support system at home is associated with better academic performance. Students should strike a balance between socializing and maintaining a regular school routine because, contrary to popular belief, spending too much time on social activities may slightly lower grades.  

Students drink more on weekends than weekdays, according to the study. This finding does not come as a surprise, considering that the majority of students' social events occur on weekends. It further demonstrates that students' social lives are associated with their alcohol use, since they are more likely to drink when they go out more frequently.  

School success isn't solely influenced by one aspect such as drinking; it involves maintaining consistency and receiving support from family while also making decisions regarding time management. That's what my project suggests. Of solely focusing on risk avoidance strategies alone; schools and parents should aid students in cultivating robust support networks and effective study routines while maintaining a healthy equilibrium, between academic responsibilities and social interactions. Ensuring the success of children both academically and, in their lives involves recognizing and tackling the elements that greatly influence their performance in school and beyond.
