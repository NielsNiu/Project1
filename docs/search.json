    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n1.0.1 Introduction\nPeople are now beginning to drink alcohol at younger ages, and it appears that this trend is occurring earlier and earlier. I became interested in the effects of alcohol use on high school students’ academic performance and general well-being after making this observation.\nFor this project, I want to explore and dive deeper into this social science field by analyzing real-world student data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I’ll use this dataset to investigate the connections between students’ grades, study habits, and health and alcohol use, both during the week and on the weekends. I’ll also look into how drinking behavior is influenced by social and familial factors like family ties, parental education, and time spent with friends.\nI will use fundamental statistical methods like regression modeling, t-tests, and correlation analysis to address these queries. I intend to draw attention to the possible impacts of alcohol on academic performance and general well-being by utilizing data to identify trends. In addition to improving our knowledge of statistics, this project clarifies a significant problem that impacts students all over the world.",

This will help determine whether alcohol consumption has a measurable impact on students’ final grades.\n\n\n3.1.2 Hypothesis\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between alcohol consumption and final grades.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher alcohol consumption negatively affects students’ final grades.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Regression Model Setup\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"student-mat.csv\")\nmodel &lt;- lm(G3 ~ Dalc + Walc, data = df)\nsummary(model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = G3 ~ Dalc + Walc, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-10.6356  -2.0522   0.3644   3.3644   9.3644 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This means that students who do well at the beginning of the year are likely to keep doing well. Family support (famrel) has a small positive effect on grades, meaning students with good family relationships tend to perform better in school. Absences have a small positive connection to final grades. This suggests that some students can do well even if they skip school, possibly because they study independently. On the other hand, extracurricular activities might slightly lower grades, suggesting that it can be hard to balance schoolwork with other activities. Surprisingly, drinking alcohol (Dalc, Walc) does not appear to influence grades, which suggests that alcohol use does not directly affect academic performance according to this data. The model accounts for about 85% of the differences in final grades, but by removing unneeded factors and looking at how different variables work together, we could improve the predictions even more.",

    "text": "This study looks at how drinking alcohol, having a social life, and getting support from family impact students’ grades. Many think that drinking affects grades, but the evidence shows that alcohol use doesn’t significantly impact school performance. The best way to guess a student’s final grade is by checking their past grades. Doing well at the start of the school year is important for success, and working hard regularly is more important than any one habit or action.\nThere is a correlation between student achievement and family support. Encouragement from parents and guardians can have a significant impact, as having a strong support system at home is associated with better academic performance. Students should strike a balance between socializing and maintaining a regular school routine because, contrary to popular belief, spending too much time on social activities may slightly lower grades.\nStudents drink more on weekends than weekdays, according to the study. This finding does not come as a surprise, considering that the majority of students’ social events occur on weekends. It further demonstrates that students’ social lives are associated with their alcohol use, since they are more likely to drink when they go out more frequently.\nSchool success isn’t solely influenced by one aspect such as drinking; it involves maintaining consistency and receiving support from family while also making decisions regarding time management. That’s what my project suggests. Of solely focusing on risk avoidance strategies alone; schools and parents should aid students in cultivating robust support networks and effective study routines while maintaining a healthy equilibrium, between academic responsibilities and social interactions. Ensuring the success of children both academically and, in their lives involves recognizing and tackling the elements that greatly influence their performance in school and beyond.",
